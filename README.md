# T-Shirt Website with ThreeJS, React Three Fiber, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion

Welcome to our ShirtCanvas website repository! This project combines the power of ThreeJS, React Three Fiber, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion to create a visually stunning and interactive platform for designing custom t-shirts.

## Technologies Used

### ThreeJS
[ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) is a powerful 3D graphics library for rendering and animating 3D models. In this project, ThreeJS is utilized to create immersive 3D representations of custom t-shirts, allowing users to visualize their designs in a realistic environment.

### React Three Fiber
[React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) is a popular library for creating 3D graphics with ThreeJS in React. It provides a declarative and React-friendly approach to working with ThreeJS, making it easy to integrate 3D elements into React applications.

### TailwindCSS
[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS styling framework that enables rapid development of custom UI designs. In our project, TailwindCSS is used to style and layout the user interface of the T-Shirt website, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design.

### Framer Motion
[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) is a widely-used library for adding animations and transitions to React websites. By incorporating Framer Motion into our project, we bring the T-Shirt website to life with engaging animations, enhancing the user experience and making interactions more dynamic.

## Features

- **Custom T-Shirt Design**: Users can upload images and designs to visualize them on the t-shirt in real-time, thanks to the interactive 3D environment created with ThreeJS and React Three Fiber.
